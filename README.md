# FeralBlogger
A neural net for generating posts in the style of current popular tumblr bloggers. This is my first foray into tkinter and neural nets, and my entry for Birmingham Open Hack.

REQUIREMENTS: textgenrnn library for python, keras 2.2.0 and tensorflow 2.2.0 packages for python (you can get all of these via pip)

HOW TO USE: Run gui.py. That's literally it. Make sure you also have access to a console that you can read, because I've spent about 12 hours trying to get tkinter to display the output from tensorflow to no avail.
